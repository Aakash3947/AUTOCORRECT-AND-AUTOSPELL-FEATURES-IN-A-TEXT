AUTOCORRECT AND AUTOSPELL FEATURES IN A TEXT
This implementation introduces a streamlined algorithm for identifying and correcting
misspellings by finding the nearest match from a given word database. By employing
traditional natural language processing techniques, the algorithm first preprocesses both the
input search term and the entries in the database, ensuring consistency through text
normalization and the removal of non-alphanumeric characters.
Next, it utilizes N-gram analysis to create sequences of characters for both the search term and
each database word, which facilitates the quick identification of candidates with notable
similarities. The algorithm then calculates the Levenshtein distance—a metric that measures
the least number of single-character edits needed to transform one word into another—to
pinpoint the closest match from the shortlisted candidates.
The result is a user-friendly output that presents the best matching word along with its
Levenshtein distance, making it an effective solution for spelling correction and suggestion
tasks. This method is especially useful in applications like text input systems and search
functionalities, enhancing the user experience by effectively handling typographical errors
without employing AI or machine learning techniques.
